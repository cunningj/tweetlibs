# tweetlibs

Single page webapp and twitter-bot I co-developed with fellow Montana Code School students via mobbing.

The server listens for incoming tweets at our account that contain a certain hashtag.
When that hashtag is present in the tweet the bot initiates a mad-libs game with the requesting user.
When the bot has all the required info it tweets out the final result.

Tech used:
node
express
mongodb
mongoose
passport
xhr
oauth
